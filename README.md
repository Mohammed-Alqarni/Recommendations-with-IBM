# Recommendations with IBM

## Overview
This project builds a recommendation system for articles on the IBM Watson Studio platform using methods like rank-based recommendations, collaborative filtering, and matrix factorization (SVD). It aims to improve user engagement by suggesting relevant content.

## Key Features
- **Exploratory Analysis**: Insights into user behavior and article popularity.
- **Rank-Based Recommendations**: Suggests the most popular articles.
- **Collaborative Filtering**: Uses user-user similarity for recommendations.
- **Matrix Factorization (SVD)**: Predicts user-article interactions and optimizes latent features.
- **Cold Start Handling**: Recommends popular articles for new users or articles.
- **A/B Testing**: Proposes a framework to evaluate recommendation effectiveness.

## Files
- `Recommendations_with_IBM.ipynb`: Main notebook with implementation.
- `Recommendations_with_IBM.html`: HTML version of the notebook.
- `data/`: Includes datasets for analysis.

## Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn

## Instructions
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install libraries with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run `Recommendations_with_IBM.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.

## Insights
- Combining rank-based and collaborative filtering works well for sparse datasets.
- SVD performs effectively but depends on sufficient overlap between training and testing data.
